                I am Karen Jean Allones writting my testimony about the training of Empowering Community ALS Implementer thru ICT
                
                I am writing this testimony to express my utmost admiration to the Trainers/ Teachers and Staffs of Northern Bukidnon State College especially to the College of Computer Studies for making this ICT training possible, for me as one of the Community ALS Implementer of Manolo Fortich District it is a big help to widen and broaden my learning in terms of technology, I will use this knowledge to enhance and equipped my learners in the future.
                
                During the learning process I have learned a lot of things, first is knowing the hardware, software, front and back panel of a System Unit the trainer/teacher explain to us very will the detailed  and what are the specific functions of each device, Second familiarizing the some of the shortcut keys and exploring the function and use of spreadsheets and how to use the different formulas in the Microsoft Excel the trainers/teachers  are very hands on in teaching us the different techniques, third is how to make a presentation using Microsoft PowerPoint in this session I learned the different effects and function of each tool bar this is very useful for me in making and delivering my lessons to my future learners for them to be more engage in my lesson.
                
                Lastly is making a simple webpage which is very critical and challenging not just for me but also to my colleagues during the whole training it really test my patience and ability, which is part of the whole process, I am very lucky to be part of this opportunity, I am so thankful to be given this chance because now a days ICT is so useful and very helpful, technology now adays is part of the modernization of the world.
                
                I am very thankful to those people behind all this training sessions, I know they put much more effort to make this whole learning process engaging, fun and enjoyable. I am very excited to share this new learning to my future learners.
